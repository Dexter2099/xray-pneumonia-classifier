# X-ray Pneumonia Classifier

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using PyTorch to classify chest X-ray images as either **Pneumonia** or **Normal**. It is designed for beginners looking to explore medical imaging and deep learning.

## ü©∫ Project Motivation

Pneumonia is a potentially serious lung infection. Early detection through chest X-ray interpretation is critical. This project mimics a clinical workflow where a model assists radiologists by classifying X-ray scans. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle - Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed image data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA
- `src/`: Source code for data handling, modeling, training, and visualization
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `outputs/`: Saved model checkpoints and visual outputs
- `main.py`: Entry script for training and evaluation
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## üöÄ Features

- PyTorch-based CNN for binary image classification
- Medical image preprocessing
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix
- Grad-CAM visualization to interpret model attention
- Config-driven design for modular experimentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xray-pneumonia-classifier.git
    cd xray-pneumonia-classifier
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
